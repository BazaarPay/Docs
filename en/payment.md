}
```

<h2 id="payment-flow">Payment flow</h2>

<h3 id="payment-flow-android">Android SDK</h3>

To implement this type of payment method, visit the following address:

[Android SDK Guide](https://github.com/cafebazaar/BazaarPay)

<h3 id="payment-flow-web">Web</h3>

If the acceptor is unable to implement the SDK for any reason or there is no SDK for the desired platform, the user can be redirected directly to the BazaarPay portal and after the user completes the payment flow, the user will be redirected to the requested page with the payment status.

1.After receiving the payment_url in the response to the init-checkout call, you must redirect the user to that URL. You can also add the query params described in the table below to the payment_url:

```yaml
QueryParams:
  - name: token
    type: string
    required: true
    description: The `payment_url` that is used in the output of this endpoint will be returned, you can put this value in the query param or for convenience just use `/checkout/init/`. This is the token used for the payment process.
  - name: redirect_url
    type: string
    format: encodedURL    # must be encoded by encodeURIComponent
    required: true
    description: The return address to the merchant where the user will be returned if successful/unsuccessful. Be sure to include your return address.
  - name: phone
    type: string
    required: false
    description: The user's contact number, which is automatically filled in to speed up the login process.
```

<h4 id="payment-flow-web-sample">Example of using a payment url</h4>

This address will be returned in `/checkout/init/`.

```
https://{base_url}{base_path}/payment?token=checkout_token
```

If you use the provided query params, the sample address will look like this:

```
https://{base_url}{base_path}/payment?token=checkout_token&phone=user_phone_number&redirect_url=merchant_redirect_url
```

And the final example would look like this:

```
https://cafebazaar.ir/bazaar-pay/payment?token=3258455376&phone=09123456789&redirect_url=https://bazaar-pay.ir
```

<h2 id="commit">Confirm payment</h2>

Calling this endpoint is a declaration of the authenticity of the product or service provided by the acceptor to the user. By calling this endpoint, the transaction is finalized and if this endpoint is not called, the entire transaction amount will be automatically returned to the user's wallet after a few minutes.

* The interval between these two days should not be more than 31 days.
* If the value of filter_date_by is equal to refund_date, only checkouts that have a value for the refund_datetime field will be displayed in the output. So as a result, only checkouts that have been refunded will be displayed in the output.
* If the value of filter_date_by is equal to payment_date, only checkouts that have a value for the payment_datetime field will be displayed in the output. So as a result, only checkouts that have been paid will be displayed in the output.
