<h1 id="login-by-merchant">User Authentication by Merchant</h1>

In this process, instead of authenticating (logging in) to BazaarPay, the user authenticates on the merchantâ€™s site or application
and then the mobile number is sent to BazaarPay by the merchant so that an access token can be created for this mobile number and used to access BazaarPay services
. Please note that this access token must be recreated for each payment process.

In this case, the user does not need to log in separately to BazaarPay. Client SDKs
that support this automatic authentication feature (Android SDK
from [version 5.2.0](https://github.com/cafebazaar/BazaarPay/releases/tag/5.2.0)),
use the access token provided by the merchant to continue the user's operation if the user is not already logged in to BazaarPay.

You can see the sequence diagram of this process below:

```mermaid

participant User
participant Merchant

Merchant ->> BazaarPay: Send user mobile number
BazaarPay -->> Merchant: Receive access token
Note over BazaarPay, Merchant: Create User Access Token
Merchant ->> BazaarPay: Request to create checkout token
BazaarPay -->> Merchant: Send checkout token (and payment address)
Note over BazaarPay, Merchant: Initiate Checkout
Merchant ->> web / android sdk: Transfer access token and checkout token to SDK and start payment flow
web / android sdk ->> User: Open pop-up/transfer user to payment address
User ->> BazaarPay: Perform successful payment operation
BazaarPay ->> Merchant: Transfer user to merchant
Merchant ->> User: Provide product to user
Merchant ->> BazaarPay: Confirm purchase operation
Note over Merchant, BazaarPay: Commit
```

<h2 id="create-user-access-token">Getting an access token for the user from the acceptor</h2>

After authenticating the user on its site, the acceptor can get an access token for the user's mobile number via the `create-user-access-token` endpoint.

This access token can only be used for one of the following three scopes:

1. purchase: For purchases via wallet, bank gateway, or direct debit

2. increase_balance: For the process of directly increasing the wallet balance

3. direct_pay: For the automatic payment process

If you use the token created in another scope, you will encounter a 403 error.

}
```

If the acceptor receives a response with status code 403,
it should continue the payment process without an automatic access token.
This may occur due to the temporary disabling of automatic authentication for technical reasons.

<h2 id="auto-login-android">Automatic Authentication on the Android Platform</h2>

To see how automatic authentication is enabled in the Android SDK,

see the [sdk documentation](https://github.com/cafebazaar/BazaarPay#2-launch-payment).

<h2 id="auto-login-web">Automatic authentication on the web platform</h2>

This service receives the user's authentication token using the query param and performs the desired processes using the authenticated token.

<h4 id="direct-call">Direct web service call</h4>

At each entry point of the web service, by passing the query param `auto_login_token`, the web service will recognize the authentication method as autologin and by the end of the desired process, the user will be authenticated with that token. Keep in mind that the value of this query param must be initialized by `access_token`, which is returned in the `create-user-access-token` endpoint.
